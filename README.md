# AlphaPlayer

### Getting the API to work
In order to start the API you need to create a `config.ini` file in the AlphaPlayer directory
You can change those options:
* `api=true/false` - Set the API to on or off
* `port=1337` - Set the API port (Optional, default is 8080)
* `web_files_relative_path=API/` - Tells to AlphaPlayer where is the API files are (Required if the API is on)
